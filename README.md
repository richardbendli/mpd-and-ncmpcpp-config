# mpd and ncmpcpp config


## Music Player Daemon(MPD) is an flexible, powerful server side music player application for linux. It plays audio files, organizes playlists and maintains music database. MPD cannot be accessed directly. There must be a client side application which enables you to access it. For our case we will use ncmpcpp as our client app.
